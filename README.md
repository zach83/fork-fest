# fork-fest
A GitHub script to update all of your forks for you!

Why?
-

Other applications are difficult to use, or require you to make modifications to repositories rather than meeting you half way. Plus, all you need is `gh` for your `bash` shell!

Usage
-

If you would like to update a fork, run the script with the name(s) of your repository as the argument. Similarly, if you want to update all of your forks, just add "all" as an argument.

Contributing
-

If you would like to improve this project, it is advised that you use [fork-update-test](https://github.com/F1nx/fork-update-test) so that you do not make any unintended commits on your own repositories. The ultimate goal of this project is to contribute to [`gh`](https://github.com/cli/cli) by turning this desired script into a command in `Go`.
